# Heads and Tails Project

This project is a web-based application that allows users to flip a coin, record multiple tosses with user-defined inputs, and visualize the cumulative results using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it features a responsive design and integrates a pie chart to represent the cumulative outcomes.

## Features

- **Coin Flipping**: Users can flip a virtual coin and view the outcome (heads or tails).
- **Multiple Tosses with Input**: Users can specify the number of times they want to toss the coin and record the outcomes.
- **Local Storage**: All toss records are stored locally, allowing users to revisit their previous tosses even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Pie Chart Visualization**: The cumulative results of the coin tosses are visualized using a pie chart for easy interpretation.
